# LungCancerDetection
A CNN based detection for lung cancer by slicing 3D images of existing tumers into 2D, this project only includes the pre-processing used with python and the final files created.

What the python scripts do are as follows:

preprocessing_lung - creates the database files for CNN
input_dcm_read - used to open DCM file and converts it to image for testing CNN
Pre processing features - not used in project just useful functions for reference
